## 2.0.3
* Added the Entity Blocks module, which provides block types that can display
  any renderable entity without needing a context. This allows content editors
  to easily embed existing content in a landing page using the in-place editor.
  (Issue #2667896)
* Lightning now includes Search API with an out-of-the-box site search page, a
  database backend, and sane default configuration. (Issue #2674180)
* Added help text to the edit form for workspaces that documents how to push a
  workspace's content live. (Issue #2835105)
* Fixed a bug where Lightning Media failed to declare its dependency on
  CKEditor. (Issue #2847011)
* Lightning Workflow now includes a column on the content list page that
  indicates if a piece of content has unpublished edits (a.k.a forward
  revisions). (Issue #2837788)
* Fixed a bug that could cause an exception when translating a field.
  (Issue #2841172)
* It's now possible to display taxonomy terms using Panelizer. (Issue #2664574)

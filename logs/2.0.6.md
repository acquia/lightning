## 2.0.6
* All user roles provided by Lightning's various components have been split out
  into a new sub-component of Lightning Core, called Lightning Roles. This
  sub-component is installed with Lightning by default, but you can disable it
  in a sub-profile. If it's disabled, Lightning will not create or install any
  user roles. (Issue #2855724)
* New entity reference fields that reference media items will now use
  Lightning's media browser by default. This change only applies to new entity
  reference fields; existing fields are left alone. (GitHub #298)
* A preview of embed code-based media items will now be displayed when adding
  or editing them outside of the media browser. (Issue #2825935)
* Fixed a bug where the file upload widget used by Lightning's media and image
  browsers would wrongly assume that all media bundles use a source field.
  (Issue #2861292)
* Drush, which is included with Lightning as a dev dependency, was patched to
  fix a problem where dependencies of parent profiles could not be uninstalled.
  (GitHub #311)
* The lightning.config_helper service is deprecated and replaced by a new
  facade for manipulating a module's default configuration. (GitHub #303)
* Many tags have been added to Lightning's Behat test suite to make it easier
  to isolate and run (or skip) individual tests. (Issue #2862119)
* The internal Lightning Dev module now generates a special behat.yml file in
  Drupal's public files directory, allowing any module to expose its own Behat
  test suite by including a tests/behat.yml file. (GitHub #299)

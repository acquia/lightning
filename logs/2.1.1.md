## 2.1.1
* Panels, Panelizer and Page Manager have been upgraded to their new (stable!)
  8.x-4.x releases. These releases use the experimental Layout Discovery module
  in Drupal core, and will turn off Layout Plugin upon installation. Layout
  Discovery is incompatible with Layout Plugin, so do NOT install Layout Plugin
  once the upgrade is complete. (Issue #2870521)
* The media browser will now be filtered conditionally when used with media
  reference fields, depending on which media types the field can reference.
  (Issue #2869240)
* Implemented an API for bulk entity creation. A UI for bulk upload media items
  was implemented, then pulled due to packaging issues. A patch containing that
  UI is available at
  https://www.drupal.org/node/2672038#comment-12044162, and will be merged back
  into Lightning when the packaging problems are fixed. (Issue #2870740)
* Fixed a bug where Lightning Workflow would wrongly interfere with the Save
  button when creating or editing unmoderated content types. (Issue #2867465)
* Fixed a bug where uninstalling Field UI would break Lightning due to an
  implicit dependency. (GitHub #340 and #327)
* Search API was updated to its latest release candidate. (GitHub #334)
* Listed third-party Lightning Media integrations in the README. (GitHub #339
  and #346)
* Lightning now uses short array syntax in all of its code. (Issue #2867638)

## 2.1.3
* Created new Drupal Console commands that generate and customize behat.yml
  configuration files for functional testing. (Issue #2812775 and GitHub #350)
* Fixed a bug where the media library filter was hidden when the contextual
  filter value was "all". (GitHub #352 and #354)
* Updated Panels, Panelizer, Page Manage, and CTools to stable releases.
  (Issue #2874521)
* Fixed a bug where Lightning could, under certain circumstances, break Drupal's
  configuration sync functionality. Now, when a config sync is in progress,
  Lightning will avoid making any changes to active configuration.
  (Issue #2870864)

## 2.1.4
* Implemented UX improvements for media reference fields using Lightning's
  media browser -- the maximum number of items you can select will be displayed
  above the field. (GitHub #363)
* Fixed a bug where the media browser's upload widget, when used with an entity
  reference field, would not respect the media bundles that the field could
  reference. (GitHub #370)
* Fixed a bug where content types that do not use Workbench Moderation would not
  display their "Create new revision" checkbox. (Issue #2876698)
* All of the entity view and form displays bundled with Lightning now include
  region information. (GitHub #366)
* Patched Drupal core to suppress non-actionable warnings about expected
  behavior. (Issue #2878149 and GitHub #372)
* Various default configuration bundled with Lightning Media was updated.
  (GitHub #365)
* Hid the "Entity View" block provided by CTools from Panels IPE, since it was
  not compatible anyway. (Issue #2834173)
* Acquia Connector, Media Entity Instagram, Metatag, and Search API were
  updated to their latest versions. (GitHub #376)
* Patched Panels to include three UI/UX improvements. (Issue #2884163)
* Implemented a system to continuously generate configuration snapshots so that
  config schema changes made by modules can be propagated into Lightning's
  bundled default configuration. (GitHub #368)
* Implemented a safeguard to ensure that dependencies which Lightning is
  patching are always be pinned to a specific version. (GitHub #361)

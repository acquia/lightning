## 2.1.7
* Security updated Drupal core to 8.3.7.
* Updated Entity Browser to 1.1.
* Lightning has a new top-level component called Content API. This component is
  installed by default and exposes all entities in your site in the
  machine-consumable JSON API format. This makes Lightning friendlier to
  decoupled applications, and allows it to be used as a backend for such. As
  part of this feature, Lightning now includes the JSON API, OpenAPI, and
  Simple OAuth modules, with basic default configuration.
  (GitHub #423, #421, #424, #433, and Issue #2896267)
* Lightning now supports bringing in front-end JavaScript libraries with
  Composer, via Asset Packagist. To take advantage of this in your
  Composer-based Lightning project, follow the instructions at
  http://lightning.acquia.com/blog/round-your-front-end-javascript-libraries-composer
  (GitHub #431)
* Lightning Core no longer has a hard dependency on the Metatag or Menu UI
  modules. (GitHub #418, #420 and #427)
* Lightning no longer has an implicit hard dependency on the Bartik or Seven
  themes. (Issue #2899017)
* Page Manager is no longer required by Lightning Layout. It is still shipped
  with Lightning, but is not a dependency and will be removed from Lightning in
  the next release. If you are using Page Manager, you must explicitly include
  it as a dependency of your project. Otherwise, you should uninstall it as
  soon as possible. (GitHub #410)
* Quick Edit is no longer visible on published content when Lightning Workflow
  is enabled, because Quick Edit does not deal properly with forward revisions.
  In Lightning, you will only be able to use Quick Edit on unpublished drafts.
  (Issue #2894874)
* Split scheduled update functionality into a sub-component of Lightning
  Workflow, installed by default on new Lightning sites. (Issue #2893542)
* Panels was updated to version 4.2. (GitHub #409)
* Removed unnecessary lightning_core_entity_load(). (GitHub #406)

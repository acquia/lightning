## 2.1.8
* Added the ability to easily crop images contained in media entities and use
  the cropped version when embedding or selecting the media item.
  (Issue #2690423)
* Lightning Media now includes a bulk upload form that allows you to create
  multiple image media entities at once. (#2672038)
* You can now run Lightning's manual update steps via an interactive Drupal
  Console command. (GitHub #462)
* OAuth key pairs:
  * Lightning will no longer try to guess where keys should be stored and won't
    generate the keys until an administrator triggers that action. (GitHub #445)
  * Key pairs are now generated with 600 permissions. (GitHub #443)
  * Better error messages are shown if the system encounters an error when
    generating OAuth key pairs. (GitHub #440)
* Lightning no longer patches Drush and therefore has no opinion about which
  version of Drush you use in your project. (GitHub #459)
* Page manager is no longer included in the codebase. (GitHub #466)
* You can now choose to hide the links to API docs shown on entity bundles via a
  config option. (GitHub #435)
* Fixed a bug where Entity Browser filters might not work after updating to core
  8.3.7. (GitHub #441)
* Operations is now the last column on the admin/content view. (GitHub #429)

## 3.0.2
* Drupal Core has been security updated to 8.4.5.
* The `update:lightning` command:
  * Has been ported to Drush 9.
  * Reads the previous version from config and, as a result, no longer requires
    nor accepts the `version` argument.
  * Usage:

  ```
  drush update:lightning
  # To run all available configuration updates without any prompting, use:
  drush update:lightning --no-inetraction
  ```
  * Note: Configuration updates from versions of Lightning < 3.0.0 will not be
    run when using the updated command. You should update to the last available
    2.2.x release before updating to 3.x.
* All Lightning components have been updated to RC1 or greater and are no longer
  pinned to specific releases.
* Component updates:
  * Lightning API has updated JSON API to 1.10.0. See Lightning API's CHANGELOG
    for more information. (Issue #2933279 and SA-CONTRIB-2018-15)
  * Lightning Layout has fixed a configuration problem that caused an unneeded
    dependency on the Lightning profile. This means that Lightning Profile is
    now fully compatible with the
    [Config Installer](https://www.drupal.org/project/config_installer).
    (Issue #2933445)
  * Lightning Media now allows media types to be configured without a Source
    field. (Issue #2928658)
  * Lightning Workflow can now be installed without the Views module.
    (Issue #2938769)
* Note: This is the last release on the 8.4.x branch of Drupal Core. The next
  Lightning release will be 3.1.0 and will require core ~8.5.0.

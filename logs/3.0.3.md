## 3.0.3
* Lightning API has been updated to RC3, which:
  * Only sets up developer-specific settings when Lightning's internal
    developer tools are installed.
  * The Entity CRUD test no longer tries to write to config entities via the
    JSON API because it is insecure and unsupported, at least for now.
* Lightning Core has been updated to RC2, which:
  * Moves the Behat contexts used for testing into Lightning Core.
  * Renames the lightning.versions config object to lightning_core.versions.
* Lightning Media has been updated to RC3, which only sets up developer-
  specific settings when Lightning's internal developer tools are installed.

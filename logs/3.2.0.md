## 3.2.0
* Updated Lightning Core to 3.0, which requires Drupal core 8.6.0.
* Updated Lightning Workflow to 3.0.
* Updated Lightning Media to 3.0.
* Pathauto is now installed by default. (#588)
* The `lightning:subprofile` command is no longer compatible with the
  sub-profile system from Drupal 8.5.x. The `dependencies` list is replaced by
  `install`, `base profile` is the name of the base profile instead of an
  array, and all excluded modules and themes are listed in a single `exclude`
  array. (#585)

## 3.2.6
* Updated Lightning Core to 3.7, which:
  * Security updated Drupal core to 8.6.10 (SA-CORE-2019-003).
  * Security updated Metatag to 1.8 (SA-CONTRIB-2019-021).
  * Now supports attaching pictures to user accounts, and includes a Compact
    display which displays the user's picture and name, both optionally linked
    to the user's profile. (Issue #3026959)
  * Now includes a "Long (12-hour)" date format, which formats dates and times
    like "April 1, 2019 at 4:20 PM".
  * Fixed a bug where Lightning's utility to convert descendant profiles to the
    Drupal 8.6-compatible format would fail if the active profile was itself a
    descendant profile. (Issue #2997990)
  * Fixed an "undefined index" bug that could happen when processing form
    elements which can have legends. (Issue #3018499)
  * Namespaced all declared dependencies. (Issue #2995711)
* Updated Lightning API to 3.4, which:
  * Security updated JSON API to 2.3 (SA-CONTRIB-2019-019).
* Updated Lightning Media to 3.6, which has the following changes:
  * The media browser is now displayed in a modal dialog by default, which
  is activated by pressing the "Add media" button. When embedding media in
  the WYSIWYG editor, the media browser is unchanged (the entity browser
  used for WYSIWYG has been split out into a completely separate entity
  browser configuration in order to facilitate this). (GitHub #80)

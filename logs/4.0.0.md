## 4.0.0
* Added the Claro administration theme.
* Security updated Lightning Core to 4.1.0, which updates Drupal core to 8.7.1.
  (SA-CORE-2019-07)
* Updated Lightning Layout to 2.0.0, which:
  * Uses Layout Builder in place of Panels and Panelizer. However, both modules
    are still shipped with Lightning Layout, allowing you to migrate your
    layouts to Layout Builder manually as needed. An automated migration path
    will eventually be introduced, but until then, any Panelizer/Panels layouts
    you have should continue to work as before. (Issue #2952620)

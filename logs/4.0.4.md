## 4.0.4
* Updated Lightning Core to 4.5, which:
  * Security updated Metatag to 1.9.
  * Fixed a Drupal Console-related error that could appear even if Drupal
    Console is not installed. (Issue #3007425)
  * Sorts module version numbers recorded in the lightning_core.versions
    config by key. (Issue #3050259)
* Fixed a fatal error that could occur when enabling Devel's profiler. 
  (Issue #2867829)
* Many Behat contexts have been deprecated. This should not affect most users
  of Lightning, but if you are using Lightning's step definitions in your own
  Behat tests, there may be implications for you. (Issue #3068751)

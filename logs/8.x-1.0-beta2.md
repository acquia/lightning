## Beta 2
* Introduced the Lightning Workflow module, which provides tools for workflow
  control based on Workbench Moderation and Scheduled Updates. You can
  transition content between Draft, Needs Review, Published, and Archived
  states, or schedule content to be transitioned later.
* You can view a very basic, human-readable report of the moderation history for
  any node that supports workflow states.
* The media library plugin for CKEditor now supports the use of embed codes to
  add tweets, Instagram posts, and YouTube videos to your media library
  on-the-fly.
* It's now possible to filter your CKEditor media library by media type.

## Beta 3
* Panelizer is now included with Lightning as a dependency of the Layout
  component.
* The Layout component now includes a new content type called Landing Page -- a
  simple node type whose layout is controlled out-of-the-box by Panelizer. This
  replaces the previous method of creating Landing Pages view Page Manager. As a
  result, we have removed the Create Landing Page shortcut since you can create
  Landing Pages from the same place you create other nodes.
* Fixed a bug where the Body field was not present on the Basic custom block
  type.
* Patched Panels and Workbench Moderation to make them play nice together. At
  this time, it is possible to use the Panels in-place editor ONLY on the latest
  revision of panelized content. (Put another way -- if Quick Edit does not show
  up, neither will Panels IPE.)
* Updated several modules to their latest tagged versions.
* The Media component has been split into several smaller features -- one each
  for image, Twitter, video, and Instagram support. All depend on the main
  Lightning Media module and are enabled by default.
* All Lightning components are now packaged using Features, and Features is
  included and enabled in Lightning by default. Features UI is included, but not
  installed.

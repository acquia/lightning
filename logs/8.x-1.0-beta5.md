## Beta 5
* Lightning now automatically provides responsibility-based roles for
  assigning permissions to users. All content types receive their own
  "Creator" and "Reviewer" roles, the main difference being that creators
  do not have the power to publish content. There is a basic "Media Creator"
  role for creating new media assets, and a more powerful "Media Manager"
  role for administrative purposes. Content type roles have limited power
  to control the layout of individual pieces of content, but there is
  a "Layout Manager" role for setting the default layouts for content types.
  (Issue #2670614)
* Lightning no longer provides the option to install demo content.
  (Issue #2673258)
* Lightning enforces a less confusing, more usable user experience when
  creating moderated content. (Issue #2671238)
* When embedding a media asset in CKEditor, authors will now receive additional
  options to control the display of the asset. (Issue #2677926)
* Previously, new media types would not appear in the CKEditor media library.
  This is now fixed. (Issue #2688467)
* Scheduling multiple pieces of content to be published was previously broken.
  (Issue #2690015)
* Developers: Lightning's functional tests are now part of the Lightning
  profile, not their own sub-package. (Issue #2681359)
* Due to a bizarre issue in Panelizer, one could not save changes to landing
  pages using Panels IPE until the default layout was re-saved.
  (Issue #2678900).

## Release Candidate 1 (RC1)
* You can finally create a Lightning-based project entirely with Composer!
  See the [installer project page](https://github.com/acquia/lightning-project)
  for more information. (Issue #2693829)
* It's now possible for Quick Edit to edit content blocks placed in a landing
  page using Panels IPE. (Issue #2692391)
* A Lightning Media unit test was missing a @group annotation. (Issue #2695625)
* Lightning now adds a warning gate to ```drush update```, since Drush's code
  update mechanisms can destroy a working site. (Issue #2694367)
* All contributed modules included with Lightning have been moved into a single
  contrib directory -- no more subfolders for layout modules, media modules,
  etc. (Issue #2692229)
* We've adopted a versioning policy that should help bridge the gap between
  drupal.org (which does not support semantic versioning yet) and Composer. See
  VERSIONS.md for more information. (Issue #2693897)

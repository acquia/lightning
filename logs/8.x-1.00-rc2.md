## Release Candidate 2 (RC2)
* Updated core to 8.0.6. We also lowered the specificity on core releases for
  Composer-based installs. Core will automatically update to the latest Patch
  Release when `composer update` is issued regardless of whether there is a new
  release of Lightning. This was already the case since Drupal Packagist
  automatically adds a tilde to the drupal/core, but it's now documented and
  we've added the tilde to our own composer.json file to avoid confusion.
* Updated the following dependencies:
  * CTools: alpha24 -> alpha25
  * Workbench Moderation: beta1 -> beta3
  * MetaTag: beta5 -> beta7
  * Acquia Connector: 8.x-1.0 -> 8.x-1.1
* Fixed an issue where the path to a JS library was duplicated and caused
  problems when JS aggregation was turned off. (Issue #2700685)
* Fixed an issue where users editing layouts with the IPE affected other users
  until the changes were saved. (Issue #2701433)

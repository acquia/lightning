* Lightning now includes an image browser for uploading images to and
  selecting images from your media library. It is automatically used
  for all new image fields by default, to give your users a much nicer
  out-of-the-box experience of dealing with image assets. The image
  browser is NOT automatically added to any existing image fields, but
  they can be manually changed to use it. (#2767213)
* Several other modules, including Entity Browser, were updated as well.
  Note that Entity Browser introduced several backwards-incompatible API
  changes, so if you have custom Entity Browser code you may need to
  update. Be safe and back up your database before running updating to
  this version of Lightning. (#2778437)
* Views Infinite Scroll was updated to 8.x-1.2. (#2773811)
* A sanity check was added to prevent fatal errors when preparing extra
  fields for media asset previews. (#2759825)
* The Lightning Extender will now search for lightning.extend.yml in sites/all
  as well as your site's individual directory. This means it's now possible for
  every site in a multisite Lightning installation to use the same extender
  configuration. (#2766337)
* Fixed a problem where the media browser would not appear when editing a node
  with an embedded tweet. (#2768849)
* The Lightning Extender's redirection feature was not working and would always
  send users to a "Drupal is already installed" error page. (#2775425)
* Fixed a PHP notice arising from the media asset preview handler. (PR #140)

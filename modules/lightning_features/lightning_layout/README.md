## Lightning Layout
Lightning Layout provides modules and configuration for great layout authoring
experiences. By default, it is automatically installed when using the Lightning
Distribution, although you have the option to turn it off during installation.

Lightning Layout uses Panels in-page editor (IPE) to enable a drag-and-drop
experience when laying out pages. It provides a new landing page content type
and a corresponding role to manage landing pages.

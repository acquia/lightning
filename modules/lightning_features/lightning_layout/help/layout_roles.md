## Layout Roles

When you create a content type, Lightning will automatically grant permission
to the content creator and reviewer roles to control the layout of *individual*
pieces of content. However, neither will be able to change the **default**
layout for any content type -- that permission rests with the special
**Layout Manager** role. The Layout Manager role always has permission to set
the default layouts for any content type.

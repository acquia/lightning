 * Defines the MediaBundleResolver annotation.

 * Bundle resolvers are plugins, defined by Lightning Media, that can take
 * indeterminate input of any type and determine if that input can be handled
 * by any existing media bundles. The input could be anything -- a string (i.e.,
 * an embed code or URL), a complete entity (i.e., an uploaded file), or
 * whatever else.
 *
 * Resolvers should return a fully-loaded media bundle entity if they find one
 * that will work for a given input, or FALSE if not.
 *
 * @deprecated in Lightning 2.0.4 and will be removed in Lightning 3.x. Media
 * type plugins should implement InputMatchInterface directly instead.

  Scenario: Uploading an image through the image browser
    Given I am logged in as a user with the page_creator,media_creator roles
    When I visit "/node/add/page"
    And I open the "Hero Image" image browser
    And I click "Upload"
    And I attach the file "test.jpg" to "File"
    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    And I enter "Behold, a generic logo" for "Media name"
    And I submit the entity browser
    Then I should not see a "table[drupal-data-selector='edit-image-current'] td.empty" element

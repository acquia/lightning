Feature: Workflow moderation states
  As a site administator, I need to be able to manage moderation states for
  content.

  Scenario: Anonymous users should not be able to access content in an unpublished, non-draft state.
    Given page content:
      | title             | path   | moderation_state |
      | Moderation Test 1 | /mod-1 | needs_review     |
    When I go to "/mod-1"
    Then the response status code should be 403
